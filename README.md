development of a number of LSTMs for a standard time series prediction problem. The problem and the chosen configuration for the LSTM networks are for demonstration purposes only they are not optimized. These examples will show exactly how to develop differently structured LSTM networks for time series predictive modeling problems. by Jason Brownlee on July 21, 2016 in Deep Learning for Time Series
